# NovelCrawler

**NovelCrawler** is a web scraping microservice that extracts novel and chapter content from supported sites. It uses Scrapy for structured crawling and Selenium with headless Chrome to bypass anti-bot protections (Cloudflare, etc.). All crawled content is saved locally and queryable through a FastAPI REST and SSE API running on port 8002.

Built with Scrapy + Selenium + FastAPI on Python 3.10+.

## Supported Sites

### Wattpad (wattpad.com)

- Uses **undetected-chromedriver** with a persistent headless Chrome session
- Cloudflare challenge bypass via Selenium
- Cookie jar persistence between crawls
- Paywall detection: logs chapters with premium content separately
- Extracts: title, author, description, cover image URL, chapter list, chapter content

### NovelWorm (novelworm.com)

- Uses **httpx** with standard HTTP requests
- Faster than Wattpad (no browser needed)
- Extracts: title, author, description, chapter list, chapter content

### ScribbleHub (scribblehub.com)

ScribbleHub is behind a **Cloudflare managed challenge**. The spider runs **cookies-only** (no
crawler-side headless browser): it reads pages with fast HTTP requests using a `cf_clearance`
cookie. The cookie is obtained automatically — no manual steps.

**How it works (self-contained, Docker-native).** A **FlareSolverr** service (added to
`docker-compose.yml`) runs headless Chrome *inside the Docker network* and solves the Cloudflare
challenge on demand. Because FlareSolverr shares the crawler's egress IP and Linux network
fingerprint, the `cf_clearance` it mints can be replayed with plain `requests` from the crawler — so
the first page is solved by FlareSolverr (~10–15 s) and the rest of the crawl is fast. Harvested
cookies are saved to the `scribblehub_cookies` table and auto-refreshed whenever the challenge
reappears (cf_clearance expires every ~30–60 min). Nothing to run on the host, nothing to paste.

- Config: `FLARESOLVERR_URL=http://flaresolverr:8191/v1` (already set on `novel_crawler` in compose).
- After pulling these changes: `docker compose up -d` (starts `flaresolverr` and recreates
  `novel_crawler`). **Settings → ScribbleHub Cookies → Test Cookies** triggers a solve and confirms.

**Why not just paste a browser cookie?** `cf_clearance` is bound to the *network fingerprint* of the
machine that solved the challenge. A cookie grabbed from Chrome on a Windows host is rejected when
replayed from inside the Linux container (different TCP/TLS fingerprint), even with the same IP and
User-Agent. FlareSolverr sidesteps this by solving from inside the container itself.

**Manual paste / host fallbacks (optional).** You can still paste a `cf_clearance` + User-Agent in
the Settings panel (used as-is if valid). If you run NovelCrawler **directly on the host** (not
Docker) you need neither FlareSolverr nor a proxy. If you prefer not to run FlareSolverr but the
crawler is in Docker, the alternative is the host proxy: run `scripts/scribblehub_host_proxy.py` on
the host and set `SCRIBBLEHUB_PROXY_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8899` (see `extra_hosts` already
set on `novel_crawler`).

**Rate limiting & guaranteed completeness.** ScribbleHub throttles per IP with **HTTP 429** (a
"slow down" signal — *not* a Cloudflare challenge, so it never burns a FlareSolverr solve). The
crawler handles it so a full novel always finishes with every chapter:

1. On a 429 it retries the same page with short exponential backoff (lets the bucket refill).
2. A chapter that's *still* rate-limited is deferred — not skipped, not fatal.
3. After the main pass, the crawler runs **retry rounds**: it waits a cooldown (so the bucket
   refills) and re-fetches the deferred chapters, repeating until none remain. So a 711-chapter
   novel completes even if ScribbleHub throttles partway through — it just takes longer.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SCRIBBLEHUB_DOWNLOAD_DELAY` | `0.35` | Seconds between chapter requests on the main pass. Raise it if you see lots of 429s. |
| `SCRIBBLEHUB_RETRY_COOLDOWN` | `45` | Seconds to wait before each retry round (escalates ×1.5 on a no-progress round). |
| `SCRIBBLEHUB_RETRY_ROUNDS` | `40` | Max retry rounds before giving up (set high for "finish no matter what"). |

Tip: heavy back-to-back crawls deplete ScribbleHub's rate-limit bucket; if a run spends a long time
in retry rounds, wait a few minutes (or raise `SCRIBBLEHUB_DOWNLOAD_DELAY`) before the next crawl.

### Inkitt batch crawling

The Inkitt batch tool is built for long, resumable runs over free completed stories. Discovery writes a
persistent catalog (`output/inkitt_batch/discovered_story_index.json`) and per-genre checkpoints
(`discovery_progress.json`), so a full catalog can be built over multiple sessions. Crawling writes each
completed story into the final export set as soon as it finishes, and already exported story IDs are
remembered in `exported_story_index.json`.

Cloudflare Tunnel protects inbound access to CreateStory, but it does not make outbound Inkitt requests
leave through Cloudflare. Requests from the `novel_crawler` container use the server/container's normal
egress route unless your infrastructure explicitly routes them elsewhere.

Recommended production posture:

- Keep Inkitt crawl workers at `1` or `2`.
- Use a `5` to `10` second request delay for long runs.
- Crawl in small runs, for example `50` to `200` stories, then download or resume later.
- Treat HTTP `429` and `403` as slow-down signals: pause, raise the delay, and resume after a cooldown.
- Keep `INKITT_RENDERED_FALLBACK=1` only when needed; browser fallback is now under the same global
  request delay gate as static fetches, but it is still heavier than plain HTML fetches.

## Adding a New Site

1. Create `configs/your_site.yaml` with CSS selectors and rate limits (see existing configs for format).
2. Create `spiders/your_site.py` extending `BaseSpider`. Set `name = "your_site"` and `config_name = "your_site"`.
3. Optionally add a handler in `handlers/site_handlers.py` if special extraction logic is needed.
4. The site is auto-detected from the URL — no further changes needed.

## Command-Line Crawling

Run crawls directly without the API:

```bash
# Wattpad (story URL)
scrapy crawl wattpad -a novel="https://www.wattpad.com/story/347718219-slug" -a limit=5

# Wattpad (chapter URL — auto-detects parent story)
scrapy crawl wattpad -a novel="https://www.wattpad.com/1284690197-slug/chapter-1" -a limit=3

# NovelWorm
scrapy crawl novelworm -a novel="https://novelworm.com/story/slug" -a limit=5
```
