"""Thin client for a FlareSolverr instance used to solve Cloudflare challenges.

FlareSolverr runs a headless Chrome and returns the solved page HTML plus the
``cf_clearance`` cookie and the (Linux) User-Agent it used. Because FlareSolverr
runs inside the same Docker network as the crawler, the cookie it mints is bound
to the crawler's own egress IP and Linux network fingerprint, so it can be
replayed with plain ``requests`` from the crawler container — no host proxy and
no manually pasted cookie required.

Enabled by setting ``FLARESOLVERR_URL`` (e.g. ``http://flaresolverr:8191/v1``).
